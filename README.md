# WhaleRoc

WhaleRoc is a **decentralized communication framework**. 
All WhaleRoc nodes are **automatically organized** to build a network topologic.
Messages coming from any node will automatically find the best path to broadcast to the whole network.

Unlike other de-centralization technologies, **WhaleRoc is open to more nodes**.
The more nodes joined, the more powerful whaleroc will be.

WhaleRoc can be used as a decentralized underlying communication service,
can be used as a blockchain system,
and also can be used as a decentralized cloud computing services platform.
Even more, in the future, opensource authors can bind their projects to WhaleRoc,
run as decentralized services in the global WhaleRoc network computer,
to serve clients all over the world.
